## Project Description

Placement Reality Check System is a web-based application designed to evaluate a student's readiness for their dream job.  
It compares user-entered skills with predefined job role requirements and identifies matched and missing skills.  
The system generates a readiness score along with personalized feedback to help students strategically improve their placement preparation.

---

## The Problem Statement

Many students apply for placements without clearly understanding whether their skills match industry requirements.  
This lack of awareness about skill gaps reduces their chances of getting selected.  
Students need a simple and accessible system that evaluates their skills and provides clear insights into their job readiness.

---

## The Solution

The Placement Reality Check System provides an interactive platform where users can enter their skills and select a desired job role.  
The system analyzes the entered skills against predefined job requirements and highlights matched and missing skills.  
It then calculates a placement readiness score and provides feedback to help students focus on improving the right areas.
